The nuclear dates of the civilization appear to be about 2500–1700 BCE, though the southern sites may have lasted later into the 2nd millennium BCE. Among the world’s three earliest civilizations—the other two are those of Mesopotamia and Egypt—the Indus civilization was the most extensive.</p>

                            <h5><strong>Historical Period:</strong></h5>
                            <p>Flourished approximately from 2600 BCE to 1900 BCE, during the Bronze Age.</p>
                            <h5><strong>Historical Significance:</strong></h5>
                            <p>Advanced Urban Planning: Harappa was one of the most prominent cities of the Indus Valley Civilization, known for its advanced urban planning. The city featured a grid-like street layout, with well-organized streets and buildings.<br/>

                                Economic and Trade Hub: It served as an important economic and trade hub. Archaeological evidence, including seals and artifacts, suggests extensive trade networks with regions as distant as Mesopotamia.<br/>
                                
                                Great Bath: Harappa is famous for the "Great Bath," a large and sophisticated public bath. It is considered one of the earliest known examples of public bathing areas and indicates the city's advanced engineering.<br/>
                                
                                Craftsmanship: The city was known for its craftsmanship, including pottery, jewelry, and figurines. Artifacts found at Harappa showcase the artistic and technical skills of its inhabitants.<br/>
                                
                                Writing System: Harappa, like other Indus Valley cities, had a script that remains undeciphered. This script appears on seals and other objects, suggesting a system of communication and administration.<br/>
                                
                                Water Management: The city had an advanced water management system, with well-planned drainage and sewage systems. This demonstrates a high level of civic engineering.</p><br/>
                            <h5><strong>Cultural and Religious Significance:</strong></h5>
                            <p>While the religious beliefs of the Harappan people are not fully understood, some artifacts suggest the presence of ritualistic practices, including fire altars and clay figurines.</p>

                    <p>
                        The purpose of the Great Bath in Harappa is a subject of speculation. Some have suggested that it was used for ritualistic bathing and purification ceremonies. While there are no specific stories associated with these rituals, they could have held cultural or religious significance for the people of Harappa.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Fire Altars:</h>
                    <p>
                         Archaeological findings of fire altars in some Harappan sites have led to speculation about possible fire-worship or religious ceremonies. These altars could be associated with some form of ritual or religious practice.
                    </p>
                    <h5>The Unicorn Seal:</h>
                    <p>
                         The famous unicorn seal found in the Indus Valley has led to speculation about mythical creatures in Harappan culture. The unicorn is depicted on the seal with an elaborate horn and is associated with a tree. While this could be a representation of a real animal, it has also been linked to mythical or symbolic creatures.
